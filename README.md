# 3D5-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This folder contains each of the assignments that I worked on and completed as part of my 3D5 Data Structures and Algorithms module in Trinity College Dublin

Assignment 1 revolved around parsing a CSV and storing the data using hash tables and linked lists

Assignment 2 was about creating arrays and then sorting them using different sorting algorithms and comparing the algorithms

Assignment 3 involved creating two Binary search trees - the first to store data and the second to store the name and wordcount of books and ensure the tree was balanced and as efficient as possible.

Assignment 4 involved firstly using DFS and BFS to traverse an unweighted graph, then using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path through a weighted graph and finally using Dijkstra to find the shortest path between bus stops in Ireland using an undirected, weighted graph.
