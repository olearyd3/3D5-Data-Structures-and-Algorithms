# 3D5-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This folder contains each of the assignments that I worked on and completed as part of my 3D5 Data Structures and Algorithms module in Trinity College Dublin

Assignment 1 revolved around parsing a CSV and storing the data using hash tables and linked lists

Assignment 2 was about creating arrays and then sorting them using different sorting algorithms and comparing the algorithms
